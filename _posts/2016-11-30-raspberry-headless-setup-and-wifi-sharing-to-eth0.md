This is a step-by-step guide of how to set up your Raspberry Pi to run "headless", that is, access it via a network connection without a keyboard or display. This guide uses Raspbian, the "Debian Jessie" version of Linux, but it should work with other versions.


Download the latest Raspian image and unzip it:

~~~ bash
wget https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian_latest -O raspbian.zip
unzip raspbian.zip
~~~

Insert you SD Card and discover the mounted partitions (usually starts with ``/dev/mmcblk0``).

~~~ bash
$ sudo mount
/dev/sda11 on /home type ext4 (rw)
/dev/sda1 on /boot/efi type vfat (rw)
â€¦
/dev/mmcblk0p2 on /media/dudu/402bfe3d-37db-48a7-a515-31edccf953df type ext4 (ro,nosuid,nodev,uhelper=udisks2)
/dev/mmcblk0p1 on /media/dudu/boot type vfat (ro,nosuid,nodev,uid=1000,gid=1000,shortname=mixed,dmask=0077,utf8=1,showexec,flush,uhelper=udisks2)
~~~

And umount them:

~~~ bash
$ sudo umount /dev/mmcblk0p1
$ sudo umount /dev/mmcblk0p2
~~~

Write the Raspbian image to your SD Card (there's no need to specify the partition at the ``of`` parameter since they'll be created again):

~~~ bash
$ sudo dd bs=1M if=./raspbian.img of=/dev/mmcblk0
4147+0 records in
4147+0 records out
4348444672 bytes (4,3 GB) copied, 318,742 s, 13,6 MB/s

$ sync
~~~

If you have access to your router/hub then you can connect the ethernet cable directly to it and the Raspberry Pi will automatically be configured through DHCP. If you don't have physical access to the router you can share your Wi-Fi connection to ethernet following the steps below.

Open your ``Network Connections``, edit the ``Wired Connection`` and under ``IPv4 Settings`` select the method ``Shared to other computers``.

Now insert your SD Card at the Raspberry Pi and power it up!

Wait for a while and check that a new IP is being announced on eth0 (in my case the 10.42.0.75)

~~~ bash
$ arp -a
(192.168.0.122) at 9c:d2:1e:06:c7:f6 [ether] on wlan0
(192.168.0.1) at c8:3a:35:19:88:10 [ether] on wlan0
(192.168.0.101) at 6c:ad:f8:b2:c6:c2 [ether] on wlan0

$ arp -a
(192.168.0.122) at 9c:d2:1e:06:c7:f6 [ether] on wlan0
(192.168.0.1) at c8:3a:35:19:88:10 [ether] on wlan0
(10.42.0.75) at b8:27:eb:98:8e:e3 [ether] on eth0
(192.168.0.101) at 6c:ad:f8:b2:c6:c2 [ether] on wlan0
~~~

Finally you can establish a SSH connection using the default username ``pi`` and password ``raspberry``:

~~~ bash
$ ssh pi@10.42.0.75
~~~

And check your network connection:

~~~ bash
curl https://google.com
~~~

Enjoy your Raspberry Pi ;-)
